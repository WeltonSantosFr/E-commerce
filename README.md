# E-commerce

My first serious project using Html, Css and JavaScript.

this is the project that we, students of the first module of Kenzie Academy Brasil Full Stack Developers course had to do, to complete the module with success, it was really challenging, we had to learn DOM in one week, and do this project at the following week, but at the end, it was very pleasuring to see how far we made with only 2 months of hard studying and dedication.

i have a long way still, but really happy with the result of this, and  forward looking for the harder and cooler projects i'll be able to do.

Ty for you time <3
